## 📘 Course Overview
**EBGN 645 – Computational Economics** develops the skills required to construct and manipulate **numerical economic models** as instruments of research and policy analysis.  
Students learn how to formulate, solve, and calibrate economic optimization and equilibrium models using **GAMS**.

Key topics include:
- Theory of mathematical programming  
- Linear and nonlinear optimization  
- Complementarity problems and equilibrium analysis  
- Calibration and numerical implementation of models  
- Introduction to high-performance computing operations
